## This is the beginning of the site Entrusted.io.

My foray into the world of blogging, but who knows what this site will becomeâ€¦

### For now, the aim of this Entrusted.io is to share my perspective on the following:

- Development
- Best practises
- Security with a skew towards security in Development
- Coaching
- Any relevantv resources I find on the way

### ~~Setting up wordpress~~
The WordPress interface is really noisy after installing a few plugins. You need plugins to get it to what seems a reasonable setup. However most of the plugins want you to register.

*Got to the point where wordpress is not worth the effort, decided to go with ghost*


### Setting up GHOST
As I am setting up my first GHOST site I will update this post to reflect what I have done to help add security to the platform.

- Put the site behind of Cloudflare
- Limit the firewall of my host to only accept incoming requests via - Cloudflare
- TBC
