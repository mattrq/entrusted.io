Hi, I am Matt, a full-stack developer / consultant with over 15 yearsâ€™ experience throughout the technology stack.

  I have been able to perform many different roles during my 10 Years working at one company, including being the Techincal Director and ISO27001 Champion. I now work for an amazing client serices ["AND Digitial"](https://and.digital) company which allows me to find out about many different companies ways of working and sectors.

I am extremely enthusiastic about technology in general, not just linked to my role, and thus constantly developing my awareness of the technology landscape and upskilling my colleagues. I have a passion for security, best practises and pragmatism.

  The posts in this blog are my own thoughts and do not represent the company I work for.
