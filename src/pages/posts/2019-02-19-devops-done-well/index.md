## What is DevOps?

DevOps is currently a Term which can be very divisive.
I like to see it as bringing the Development, System Administration and Hosting
closer together to allow faster turnaround time and increased end to end ownership. 


##Before the DevOps
Before the DevOps movement it was very normal to have the team that Developed code (Developers) independent from those
who deployed the code and kept the code running (System admins).

This inherently lead to:
- Communication
- Knowledge Silos 
- Ownership issues
- Delays
