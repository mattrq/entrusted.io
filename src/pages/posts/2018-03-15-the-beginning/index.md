## This is the beginning of the site Entrusted.io.

My foray into the world of blogging, but who knows what this site will becomeâ€¦

### For now, the aim of this Entrusted.io is to share my perspective on the following:

- Development
- Best practises
- Security with a skew towards security in Development
- Coaching
- Any relevant resources I find on the way

### The Tech

_After many attempts I have now settled on a technology, see below_

Ended on using `Github -> Gatsby -> Netlify <- Cloudflare`

*Reasons:*
 - I am a developer and this approach allows me to try static generated sites
 - 100% Free
 - Secure (Headers and all)
 - Fast... Really, Really fast

### The false starts

#### wordpress
The WordPress interface is really noisy after installing a few plugins. You need plugins to get it to what seems a reasonable setup. However most of the plugins want you to register.

*Got to the point where wordpress is not worth the effort, decided to go with ghost*


#### GHOST
Ghost is a nice but solution. However it's not a PWA/SPA and the hosting options are limited.
I did run it on digital ocean for a while $5 vs Ghost hosted option $36 per month. Which was too much for me.

If you know you are going to stick with this definitely worth trying Ghost.
